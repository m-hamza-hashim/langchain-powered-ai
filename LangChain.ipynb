In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

This usually means it's not installed or not in your system's PATH. Here's how to troubleshoot:\\n\\n1. **Check if Python is installed:**\\n\\n   Open a new terminal and try:\\n   ```bash\\n   which python\\n   which python3\\n   ```\\n   If either command returns a path (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3`), Python is installed, but might not be in your PATH.  If neither command returns a path, Python isn't installed.\\n\\n2. **Add Python to your PATH (if installed but not in PATH):**\\n\\n   The process for adding to your PATH depends on your shell (zsh, bash, etc.) and operating system. Here are a few common examples:\\n\\n   * **zsh:** Add `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/python` to your `.zshrc` file. Replace `/path/to/your/python` with the actual path from step 1.  Then, run `source ~/.zshrc`.\\n\\n   * **bash:** Add `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/python` to your `.bashrc` file. Replace `/path/to/your/python` with the actual path from step 1. Then, run `source ~/.bashrc`.\\n\\n3. **Install Python (if not installed):**\\n\\n   Download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\\n\\n4. **Check your shell configuration:**\\n\\n   Make sure your shell is configured correctly. Sometimes, issues with shell startup files can prevent commands from being found.  Try restarting your terminal or computer.\\n\\nIf you've tried these steps and are still having trouble, provide more details about your operating system and any error messages you're seeing, and I can offer more specific guidance.
